				<title>Creating Being Lost</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve written before about the web development work I do to help Cascade Orienteering Club put on events. I enjoy that behind the scenes work, making the jobs of event volunteers a little easier. From time to time, I also take a slightly more visible role in making orienteering meets happen here in the Pacific Northwest. In the past month, I’ve been spending time pouring over a detailed map of the Teanaway Community Forest, where I’m designing the course for a &lt;a href=&quot;http://cascadeoc.org/event/ultimate-orienteer-7-score-o-2017/&quot;&gt;Score O&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/course-design-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The view west from control 106&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Course design is a bit like writing a school test. The subject matter is the mapped area and the challenges it presents: in this case, a wilderness area crisscrossed with trails and few major features other than the shape of the land to use for re-orienting in the field. I create problems for the competitors to solve, and while there may be no single right answer, I should reward those with the most advanced skills and understanding. I’ll try to avoid including dumb tricks, but do make competitors think twice about their decisions. I’m working to create an experience that is fair, fun, and fast. As a designer, the highest praise is a worn-out competitor who returns to the finish with a smile on their face, ecstatic to tell me about all the mistakes they made.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My favorite part about orienteering is the rush I get in the moment of realization that I’m not where I thought I was: I’m lost. Especially in wilderness, it’s amazing to take a couple seconds to enjoy the state of being &lt;em&gt;somewhere&lt;/em&gt;, alone. Lost, but also fully equipped with the tools I need (a detailed map and a compass) to bring myself back to reality. Well, at least &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; enjoy it; friends tell me your experience my vary. With no controls in the field from which to benchmark while I’m scouting for my own course, I get to have this experience a bit more often. It slows me down, sure, but ultimately it’s why I’m here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/course-design-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The gnarly rootstock at control 173&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this three hour Score O event, I need to blanket controls over a wide area so that part of the challenge is choosing which checkpoints to visit within the event’s time limit. Ideally, even the fastest competitors (we have multiple Team USA members who frequent our meets) shouldn’t be able to clear the course. Scouting doesn’t happen at my race pace either - I need to be absolutely sure I’ve identified the correct locations or else I’ll find angry competitors complaining of a misplaced control at the finish. On my first trip to the venue, I spent close to ten hours zigging and zagging through the rolling hills, sometimes on trails, more often slipping between trees and through tall grass on the way to boulders or re-entrants with no trail in sight. I make mental notes and tie surveyor’s tape at my locations; I’ll be back in a week to set the actual controls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The day before the race I’m a little nervous; I need to cover a lot of area with control flags, stands, and the electronic punch boxes competitors use to record visiting a control. I’ve drawn up four loops for myself so that I don’t need to carry all the gear at once. These are my own little courses, and at least this time around I’ll find pink tape at each location for a confidence boost. I set three of the four loops in the afternoon sun while clouds speed by overhead. Occasional gusts threaten a storm that thankfully never materializes. On race day I wake up early to set out the last 10 controls. When it’s all done, I’ve spent nearly six hours placing equipment. Is it all in the right spot? Will anyone visit every control in half of that time? I’m about to find out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Orienteering typically uses staggered starts where competitors leave the start at two minute intervals in order to discourage following. For Score O, because there is no prescribed control order, there is a mass start. As a designer, it’s the first chance for me to evaluate my design. As competitors frantically scribble on their maps (we had a ~5 minute planning period) and discard jackets they won’t need while running, I count down to the start. “One minute! 30 seconds! Ten! Three, two, one, Go! Have fun! Don’t get lost! Come back on time!” And just like that, I’m left standing alone at a gate where the pavement turns to gravel as 50 people scatter into the surrounding terrain. I smile as I count groups headed towards at least four different first controls, maybe five. Hopefully I’ll see smiles as they return.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/course-design-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The view north from control 102&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a couple hours, I learn my fate. I’ve been defeated, the course has been cleared. There’s also a few reports that a control on the far end of the map is likely up to 200m off from where my map indicates. That’s frustrating for me to hear (and I know it was even more frustrating out on the course!) but luckily it’s not all bad news here. Finishers trickle in as the clock counts down, and it’s a jovial atmosphere as competitors discuss routes while they recover. I hear of the vistas, the amazing rock features, the subtle saddle. I share in the triumph of finding a difficult control on a small point feature in flat terrain, the sorrow in a route choice gone wrong, and the thrill of returning with seconds to spare. For me, all of this is a priceless reward. My work on designing and setting courses, once secrets, are now something I’ve shared with a community of which I’m grateful to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Post Script:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can view the map and courses from this event at CascadeOC’s &lt;a href=&quot;http://rg.cascadeoc.org/rg2/#178&amp;amp;course=2&quot;&gt;route gadget&lt;/a&gt; tool.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;While setting controls, I found across a large pile of ribbons in an area of forest off trail. This was very odd trash to find until I investigated a little further and discovered it was actually a message in a bottle that had been attached to some balloons! I contacted the sender, who reported they had launched it from Bellingham a few weeks earlier. I’ll never know if it was still floating in the sky during my scouting trip, or if I navigated within a few meters of it but missed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/course-design-4.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A home-made balloon message in a bottle. Glad I had a backpack to carry it out.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>For the Planet</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;This Saturday 22 April 2017 is the first &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marchforscience.com&quot;&gt;March for Science&lt;/a&gt;, an organized moment for people around the globe to gather in support evidence based discovery. I’ll be marching in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marchforscienceseattle.org/&quot;&gt;Seattle&lt;/a&gt;. Saturday is also Earth Day, a movement which saw its beginnings back in 1970 when millions of Americans rallied to support healthy, sustainable environmental choices. While both of these causes may have been born out of political frustration, their missions span those boundaries. No matter your opinion on &lt;em&gt;how&lt;/em&gt; government and collective action can solve the myriad challenges that our Mother Earth faces today, I hope you’ll join me on Saturday at a March for Science or Earth Day event in your community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-i-march&quot;&gt;Why I March&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;science-is-a-framework&quot;&gt;Science is a Framework&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science, specifically the scientific method of hypothesis testing, is a broad problem solving framework applicable to problems across subjects, industries, and generations. It gives us structure to approach the unknown, and allows progress even in the light of failure. Science tells us to consider what we know, make a prediction, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9kf51FpBuXQ&quot;&gt;put it to the test&lt;/a&gt;. Often the prediction will be wrong. Often when an experiment is completed it may leave more questions than answers. As much as today’s society is all about answers and progress, new information is not a failure in the eye of Science. Where would we be if every negative result became a stop order? Edison reportedly failed &lt;a href=&quot;http://edison.rutgers.edu/newsletter9.html#4&quot;&gt;thousands of times&lt;/a&gt; while working on the incandescent light bulb and other inventions. I march because Science is a problem solving framework that helps us correct our mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;science-is-hard&quot;&gt;Science is Hard&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Science may adapt to help us learn from failure, but that doesn’t mean it’s easy. Science asks humans to be objective when observing and reporting results. As a pattern-seeking species, that task is incredibly difficult, even when experimental controls are in place. Many career scientists, even academics and others in public positions, have incentives that may compete with the guidelines that science provides for experiments. Publication quotas for tenured positions. Financial rewards or promotion for positive results. Journals favoring significant results over negative findings. (For the interested, I highly recommend this &lt;a href=&quot;https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/science-isnt-broken/&quot;&gt;FiveThirtyEight piece about P-hacking&lt;/a&gt;.) Scientists can’t just be experts in their own field. Experiments bring up questions in statistics and ethics, and without a comprehensible and accurate summary, findings can fall flat. I march because the people who dedicate their lives to science deserve credit for more than discovery.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;make-a-plan&quot;&gt;Make a Plan&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wherever you participate on April 22, make a plan &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt; for a couple key things and you’ll be more likely to get out there and stay a little happier on Saturday.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Get there.&lt;/strong&gt; Where does your event start? Which bus or train do you need to catch? Remember, a march is a gathering of people, not cars: if you can avoid it, don’t bring your car.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Find your friends, and make new connections.&lt;/strong&gt; It can be surprisingly difficult to navigate through a crowd to your friends. Don’t forget to take the time to talk with those around you. You all came out for a reason, don’t be afraid to find out what other folks are passionate about and you might find a new friend. Even small discussions can help others feel more involved.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keep yourself fueled.&lt;/strong&gt; Carry some food and water if you can, bonus points if you bring a little extra you can share. Also consider supporting local businesses along the march route.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Check the weather.&lt;/strong&gt; You’re going to be outside. Thanks to radar and modeling, you’ll probably know if it’s going to be wet or cold. Bundle appropriately.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dont-stop&quot;&gt;Don’t Stop&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The scientific method doesn’t end with a negative result. Every day is Earth Day. Use April 22 as a chance to find a community where you can continue to support the causes you care about.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>What's your Win of the Day?</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Over the past week I built a little web app where anyone can come and record a win of the day. I hope this idea can grow into a nice bright corner of the internet. &lt;a href=&quot;https://WinOfTheDay.com&quot;&gt;Celebrate your Win of the Day&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/wotd.png&quot; alt=&quot;Small wins&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;motivation&quot;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, writing down a win of the day is a great way to reflect and recharge. Sometimes it feels like everything is going wrong, but even on days like those I can find something positive to keep me going. It doesn’t have to be big or special, it’s OK to feel good about the little things too. Maybe I did some cleaning, or spent some time outside, or simply got out of bed. We all have those days. And on days when things are going great, it’s exciting to reflect and celebrate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses that are changing all the time. I built Win of the Day to never publicly attach a username to a win because this isn’t about competition. It’s about individuals each doing their best; it’s about finding happiness in the joy of success for you and for others, no matter how big or how small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-notes&quot;&gt;Technical Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is yet another &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; app, so I reused a lot of boilerplate code, but also tried a few new packages. This site allows users to login and also has some pages restricted to moderators, so I needed to implement an authentication and authorization scheme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;em&gt;hate&lt;/em&gt; using social login for random web sites, so everything is happening in flask and my own database. Don’t worry, I didn’t write my own security - I’m &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)&quot;&gt;salting&lt;/a&gt; password values and using a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcrypt&quot;&gt;bcrypt&lt;/a&gt; library for hashing and password checking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking of security and passwords, you’ve probably noticed that web browsers are starting to raise more alarms when the browser detects a form transmitting data over an insecure connection. Luckily, my web host makes it super easy to to generate and install certificates from &lt;a href=&quot;https://letsencrypt.org/&quot;&gt;Let’s Encrypt&lt;/a&gt;. With a certificate in place, the Flask-SSLify library makes it trivial to force requests to be made over https.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can browse the code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ercjns/WinOfTheDay&quot;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. Feedback and pull requests welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>A Quiet Approach to PM</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;One of my friends recently posted a &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@nkkl/ballad-of-the-type-b-pm-33dfb4428a73&quot;&gt;short note&lt;/a&gt; about different PM archetypes that are explicitly &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; Type A personalities. It really resonated with me. Go ahead and read it now (3 min), then come back here for a bit of my own thoughts and experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my first job out of college, I spent two and a half years as a Program Manager at Microsoft, working on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.windows.com&quot;&gt;Windows Developer Center&lt;/a&gt;, the backbone for Microsoft’s competitor to the Apple App Store and Google Play. The Microsoft PM culture I experienced places a higher value on winning than on helping - this didn’t sit well with me. A private note I wrote at the time is a good summary of my general approach to PM, a subtext to my frustrations:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Listen to all of my teammates and find out individual, candid opinions of what’s great and what is bothersome. Never put my own opinion on a shining platter - it doesn’t have a special blessing just because I’m in the PM role. I don’t want to be calling all the shots - so I don’t, I make sure my team calls the shots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a facilitator and a strong believer that everyone is more productive when success is more than the result at the end of a series of checklists. I love the empathy driven aspect of program management - to discover and communicate user needs to the development team and to create a solution that satisfies those needs. I know I have a lot to learn from those around me, and so I choose to make the communication and discovery a two-way street, an opportunity for team learning. That might be my most radical step away from “traditional” Type A PM strategies - I happily hold court rather than issuing a decree on product direction. I’m not interested in personally winning - I’m here for the team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In itself, PM as facilitator is not a novel approach, but I was surprised by how much I stood out. That said, I worked hard, stuck to my principles, and found success. During daily standup and in one-off interactions, I kept developers aware of a project’s impact, elevating the focus above checking off isolated tasks. Even when an aspect of my spec was lacking, developers I worked with often managed to get it right the first time through implementation. We hashed out functional designs on developers’ white boards rather than my own where they couldn’t be referenced during coding. I made my office a space where no question is a dumb question, a place for discussing ideas as well as prioritization. I worked well with developers, but interactions with the PM team were a different story.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The group who I most expected to sympathize with customer stories (and the supporting data) appeared surprisingly stubborn to me. Prioritization exercises were too often won by the loudest voice in the room. While team slogged through must-have features as we played catch-up to other app ecosystems, I heard more references to competitor designs than to telemetry of our own users. When more resources became available to build new competitive features, I took the chance to instead drive something internally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this project I developed telemetry infrastructure and a &lt;a href=&quot;https://powerbi.microsoft.com&quot;&gt;Power BI&lt;/a&gt; dashboard so that individual PMs, developers, and business leaders could more easily drill into the details behind the KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) being reported to leadership. Bringing easily questioned cross-team data to PM fingertips was a win worthy of the repeated demos and celebratory e-mails. I felt good about the project’s success, but the bragging still felt out of place. To me, this was simply another way to help my teammates to do their best work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During my last year at Microsoft, I reached out to one of my previous managers for mentorship. My manager at the time was sympathetic to and appreciative of my team-building approach to driving progress, but I wasn’t sure about how to approach others on the PM team - the culture still felt overly self-centered. I wanted new strategies to experiment with while still being my authentic, pensive, pondering, but deliberate, self. Show more data. Speak up more. Celebrate achievements. Advocate for yourself. The suggestions made sense as career advice, but were hard to reconcile with my identity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My previous manager also mentioned that I wasn’t alone in my feelings: a respected colleague had decided to move on partly due to a similar internal conflict of helping versus winning. She delivered objectively great work, but had decided something wasn’t quite right. Helpfulness is a distinctly different feeling from the winning focus that seemed to fuel (and promote) my peers, and the latter had little appeal to me. I left Microsoft a few months after that conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So where does that leave the Type B PM? Every team, every company is different; not every pair will be a good fit. Of course, just as a great PM smoothly adapts a project to changing requirements and resource constraints, he (she) shouldn’t forget to also adapt himself (herself), and his (her) approaches. Find what your teammates need, and help them do it, whatever it takes. Be yourself, but also occasionally let go and &lt;em&gt;be someone who you never thought you’d be&lt;/em&gt;. I’m still experimenting with that last challenge - I like to think that every human is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cookie-cutter PM may be a Type A control freak, but diversity of approaches across a PM team can create value the same way diversity of backgrounds fuels creativity and openness through new perspectives. We all build delightful experiences by empathizing with users and wrangling teams to deliver, and every individual has their own way to be authentic and successful. It doesn’t always work out, and that’s a big part of why you’re there as a PM in the first place: to climb back aboard and get the wheels spinning again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(And if you’re looking to add a PM to your team who values teammates just like customers, or know someone who is, I’d love to hear from you.)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Sharing Bicycles</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Bike share is a transportation option becoming more and more common around the world. Bicycles have always been a great method for combatting the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Last_mile_(transportation)&quot;&gt;last mile&lt;/a&gt; problem in transportation, and while current technology has allowed bike share to become much more practical to operate, the idea of a community bike pool has been around for decades. Cities &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.velib.paris.fr/&quot;&gt;of&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://topekametrobikes.org/&quot;&gt;all&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.biketownpdx.com/&quot;&gt;sizes&lt;/a&gt;, as well as &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.republicbike.com/google_bikes.asp&quot;&gt;corporate&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S45/95/35K87/index.xml?section=topstories&quot;&gt;college&lt;/a&gt; campuses have implemented bike share to help their communities move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/pronto-01-station.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A Pronto station at the Burke Gilman Trail near U Village.&quot; /&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;em&gt;Pronto Station UD-01 at the Burke Gilman Trail near U Village. Photo by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/sounderbruce/&quot;&gt;SounderBruce&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in Seattle, there is a bit of a sour relationship with bike share. After about two and a half years of service, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prontocycleshare.com/&quot;&gt;Pronto&lt;/a&gt; will close at the end of March, and plans for a possible replacement have been tabled. The Seattle Bike Blog has a ton of reporting on this, I suggest &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.seattlebikeblog.com/2016/02/04/pronto-needs-city-buyout-before-end-of-march-how-did-we-get-here/&quot;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; as a good place to start if you want all the history. There have been a number of reports about why bike share may have failed in Seattle, but that’s not my goal here. Instead, I’d like to take a positive spin. More often than not, bicycle riders, especially those on the heavy, cruiser style bikes that most modern bike share systems use, are smiling. Let’s take a look at the joy Pronto brought to Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;enjoying-the-waterfront&quot;&gt;Enjoying The Waterfront&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the summer (and other seasons too!) you’ll find gobs of people passing time in &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.seattle.gov/parks/find/parks/myrtle-edwards-park&quot;&gt;Myrtle Edwards Park&lt;/a&gt; along the waterfront in lower Queen Anne, north of downtown. The folks at Proto knew this, and placed a station at the south end of the park, where Alaskan turns away from the water and the Elliott Bay Trail begins. Here’s a simple chart showing the number of rentals beginning at each station during 2015 and 2016. &lt;em&gt;WF-01&lt;/em&gt; at Alaskan Way and Clay, just a block from the Sculpture Park, was the starting point for nearly two thousand more rides than any other station over the two years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom:35px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://plot.ly/~ercjns/106/?share_key=QnTSge88Ub2y8NtAqVxUnA&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Trips By Station&quot; style=&quot;display: block; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plot.ly/~ercjns/106.png?share_key=QnTSge88Ub2y8NtAqVxUnA&quot; alt=&quot;Trips By Station&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%;width: 600px; max-height: 500px;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
    &lt;script data-plotly=&quot;ercjns:106&quot; sharekey-plotly=&quot;QnTSge88Ub2y8NtAqVxUnA&quot; src=&quot;https://plot.ly/embed.js&quot; async=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;joyrides&quot;&gt;Joyrides&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It shouldn’t come as a surprise that many of the riders departing from Alaskan and Clay also returned their bikes there. This station had the highest percentage of return trips with nearly 35% of trips starting and ending at &lt;em&gt;WF-01&lt;/em&gt;. But where else did users go for joyrides? Overall, 8.1% of trips started and ended at the same station, but four other stations had return rates over 20%, as shown below. Where are these stations? &lt;em&gt;DPD-03&lt;/em&gt; is at the Children’s Hospital on Sandpoint Way, where Pronto provided an opportunity for Doctors, Nurses, and Visitors to take a break and enjoy the nearby Burke Gilman Trail. &lt;em&gt;UD-01&lt;/em&gt; provided a similar opportunity for employees of U-Village and Ravenna/Bryant residents. The two other stations are in the heart of the U District: &lt;em&gt;UD-07&lt;/em&gt; at 47th and 12th and &lt;em&gt;UW-02&lt;/em&gt; at the Burke Museum on the NW corner of the UW campus. I won’t speculate on the possible activities but the beauty is that these stations all provided the joy of a spontaneous bike ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;biking-with-friends&quot;&gt;Biking with Friends&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Riding just for riding is great, but riding with friends is even better! The Pronto data can’t capture when someone rents a Pronto bike to join a friend on a personal bike, but I can make some estimations about when groups rent Pronto bikes together. For my analysis, I looked for trips which started and ended at the same station, and which started and ended within two minutes of each other. There were plenty of pairs, but there were plenty of large groups too!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A group of eight rode from The Space Needle (&lt;em&gt;SLU-22&lt;/em&gt;) to The Sculpture Park (&lt;em&gt;WF-01&lt;/em&gt;) at 8pm in August 2016 - just in time to see watch the sunset from the water!&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A group of twelve (!) enjoyed the waterfront from Occidental Park (&lt;em&gt;PS-04&lt;/em&gt;) to the Sculpture Park (&lt;em&gt;WF-01&lt;/em&gt;) in June 2016.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A group of six chose Pronto bicycles for the six-block journey from 3rd and Broad (&lt;em&gt;BT-01&lt;/em&gt;) to 2nd and Vine (&lt;em&gt;BT-03&lt;/em&gt;). I’ll never know if they were just starting their night or ending a long day at 10pm on a Saturday night in August 2015.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of the 242897 trips in my the dataset, 56403 (23.2%) were a trip made with Friends. Below you’ll see the distribution of group sizes. The distribution is as expected (tons of pairs, fewer as group size increases), but the real takeaway here is the sheer volume. Taken on average, every single day there was a group of four more enjoying cycling together using Pronto bikes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin-bottom:35px&quot;&gt;
    &lt;a href=&quot;https://plot.ly/~ercjns/104/?share_key=BfMErkpkmjqKg6VOxwArCb&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; title=&quot;Groups Histogram&quot; style=&quot;display: block; text-align: center;&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://plot.ly/~ercjns/104.png?share_key=BfMErkpkmjqKg6VOxwArCb&quot; alt=&quot;Groups Histogram&quot; style=&quot;max-width: 100%;width: 600px; max-height: 500px;&quot; width=&quot;600&quot; onerror=&quot;this.onerror=null;this.src='https://plot.ly/404.png';&quot; /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;the-joy-of-bicycles&quot;&gt;The Joy of Bicycles&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is so much to love about bicycles: seeing new things! riding with friends! going fast! beating the bus! enjoying life! There’s a lot more joy to be found in this data, and I hope to periodically update this post with more findings. You can explore for yourself using the data available at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.prontocycleshare.com/data&quot;&gt;http://www.prontocycleshare.com/data&lt;/a&gt;. Thanks, Pronto, for helping support the joy of bicycling in Seattle for the past two years.&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been dreaming about ideas for a simple but off-hand useful (and fun!) twitter bot, and the ridiculous #fakenews sensation became an opportunity. Many people who have taken an intro computer science course are familiar with markov chains. Without getting too technical, a &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;markov chain&lt;/a&gt; is a process where the next outcome in the process, given the current state, is independent of past behavior, and where the possible outcomes are discrete known values. This algorithm turns out to be a great way to generate text that reads in a specific voice. (This isn’t a new trick - there are plenty of markov text generators around the web.)&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Torres del Paine Beta</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;Planning a trip to Torres del Paine? Here’s a quick overview of my trip backpacking the full in December 2016, and some things I would have liked to have known while planning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also wrote a &lt;a href=&quot;/travel/2016/12/15/chile.html&quot;&gt;full trip journal&lt;/a&gt; that I hope you’ll enjoy.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/torres-lnt.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Leave No Trace. Ama Torres Del Paine&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;getting-there&quot;&gt;Getting There&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Located at pretty much at the end of the world, it’s appropriate that getting to Torres isn’t exactly easy. But it’s not that difficult, it just takes time. Puerto Natales is the launch point for any trip into the park. During the high season, you can fly direct from Santiago. If it’s the off season, fly from Santiago to Punta Arenas, then catch a bus. The buses from Punta Arenas to Puerto Natales run almost every hour, all day long. (We were able to walk up and buy seats for the next bus, but it’s safer to buy tickets a day ahead if you can.) If you’re taking more time exploring Patagonia, you might be coming from Argentina, or taking the ferry from Puerto Mott to Puerto Natales. Without any experience to back it up, both sound like great options.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Puerto Natales has everything you need to supply your trip - there are a number of outfitters and there is one larger chain grocery store, though I didn’t visit it. If you can, use the smaller independent shops in town. Many stores sell fuel canisters, but check at your hostel first to snag unused fuel from folks just off the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of bus companies from Puerto Natales into the park. They all run just about the same schedules. We used Buses Gomez, and have no complaints. I’m sure they’re all fine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;camping&quot;&gt;Camping&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You are &lt;em&gt;required&lt;/em&gt; to have camping reservations. It’s a way to keep the crowds somewhat manageable (but oh boy is it still &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; crowded, especially considering how remote the location really is). Figure out your itinerary early and make camping reservations as soon as you can.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is what we booked for the full circuit:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Serón&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dickson&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paso&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Paine Grande&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Italiano&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Torres&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A typical itinerary for the circuit would include an additional night at Perros, and possibly replace Paso with Grey. (An alternate six night itinerary skips Dickson for Perros, and replaces Paso with Grey.) For hiking the W, most recommendations are to hike from West to East, but really there’s no wrong way to do it, although bus timings likely work better this direction. What do all these names mean? You’ll need a map for that…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;maps&quot;&gt;Maps&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The map you get from the park when you pay the entry fee is actually quite good. Here’s a photo of my copy: &lt;a href=&quot;/res/TorresDelPaineParkMap.pdf&quot;&gt;Torres del Paine CONAF Map 2016 Front&lt;/a&gt; (18MB pdf).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trails are all well marked on the map and in the terrain, and you’re not allowed to leave them, so this is more than adequate for navigation. You can find a number of versions of the map online, some better than others. Beware that the latest version (as of this writing) has some changes that are not marked on most of the online maps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can’t do the “Q” in the summer - the trail from Adminstration to Paine Grande is closed.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many maps show a trail directly from Laguna Amarga to Serón, but it no longer exists. You can walk the road, or take a shuttle to Torres Central for CLP3000.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can only walk the backside from East to West: Seron -&amp;gt; Dickson -&amp;gt; Perros -&amp;gt; Paso -&amp;gt; Grey. You’ll be turned back at ranger stations if you don’t have the right reservation.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;From Cuernos, the “shortcut” trail to Chileno is signed and cuts off before (to the West of) the small lake on the map. It appears there is a trail at the marked location east of the lake, but we didn’t notice it join the trail we were on.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;food--cooking&quot;&gt;Food / Cooking&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can find reasonable backpacking fare in Puerto Natales, though if you have specific requests you’ll do much better in Punta Arenas or Santiago. For us, breakfast and lunch were typically granola / muesli mixed with dried fruits and peanut butter, and dinner was pasta with salami and cheese. The map is a bit confusing on this, but yes, every campsite has a cooking shelter where you can use your stove. The cooking shelters are also the &lt;em&gt;only&lt;/em&gt; places you can use your stove, so pack a thermos if you want a hot beverage after leaving camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coming from bear country, the lack of guidelines for food storage was a bit boggling. We saw and used a variety of strategies. Most popular is to simply keep food with you in your tent. We also hung food from trees as well as from a trekking pole tripod. The threat is mice, but we saw little evidence and had no problems with any of these strategies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;water&quot;&gt;Water&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost everyone will tell you to just drink the water from streams, and that’s probably sound advice. I brought a filter because I don’t like giardia, but to be honest I didn’t use it 100% of the time. In an odd twist of back-country amenities, some of the camps have rigged up running water systems to provide flush toilets (!) and sinks / taps. For my stance, I’d say it’s much more important to boil or filter water you collect from the tap or other in-camp sources than to worry about filtering stream water away from camp. Water sources are fairly regular but not everywhere. You could probably get by with only one liter of capacity if you filled up at every opportunity, but you’ll be happier carrying two liters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;trails&quot;&gt;Trails&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s busy - everything is well marked and well trodden. That doesn’t mean it’s easy. You’re carrying food for seven days, and in places there are steep ascents and descents. Lots of reports warn of wind, and while we didn’t experience any prolonged strong winds, I believe the warnings. The worst trail conditions we encountered were descending from John Gardner Pass into the Paso campsite. Once you reach the tree line, the trail becomes &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; steep with makeshift handrails made from all different materials: rope, rebar, wood and PVC to name a few. Nothing else stands out as particularly notable, but here’s a few more tidbits. The trail on the east leading up to the pass is rocky but well marked. The swing brides north of Grey are long and extremely high, but at appear new-ish and well built. If you’re afraid of heights, well, don’t look down. Most (but not all) boggy areas have some sort of boardwalk, but this wouldn’t be backpacking if you didn’t get your boots dirty. Do you best to walk through mud puddles in the middle of the trail so as to not expand the trail into the terrain more than necessary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More coming soon…&lt;/p&gt;

					<description>&lt;p&gt;Seven days on the full circuit in &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Torres_del_Paine_National_Park&quot;&gt;Torres del Paine National Park&lt;/a&gt; and a few other southern hemisphere adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Atlanta: &lt;a href=&quot;#29-november-2016&quot;&gt;Day 0&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Santiago: &lt;a href=&quot;#30-november-2016&quot;&gt;Day 1&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Punta Arenas &amp;amp; Puerto Natales: &lt;a href=&quot;#1-december-2016&quot;&gt;Day 2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Torres del Paine: &lt;a href=&quot;#2-december-2016&quot;&gt;Day 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#3-december-2016&quot;&gt;Day 4&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#4-december-2016&quot;&gt;Day 5&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#5-december-2016&quot;&gt;Day 6&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#6-december-2016&quot;&gt;Day 7&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#7-december-2016&quot;&gt;Day 8&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;#8-december-2016&quot;&gt;Day 9&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Punta Arenas: &lt;a href=&quot;#9-december-2016&quot;&gt;Day 10&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Santiago: &lt;a href=&quot;#10-december-2016&quot;&gt;Day 11&lt;/a&gt; ,&lt;a href=&quot;#11-december-2016&quot;&gt;Day 12&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Toronto &amp;amp; Vancouver: Day 13&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I also have a page with &lt;a href=&quot;/travel/2016/12/16/torres-beta.html&quot;&gt;trail beta&lt;/a&gt; if that’s what you’re looking for.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-01-pass-pano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looking West to Grey Glacier and the Patagonia Ice Sheet from John Gardner Pass&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;29-november-2016&quot;&gt;29 November 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m waiting for my first flight in the Atlanta airport’s new international terminal. It’s a lofty white atmosphere with blue accents and much more natural light than other areas of ATL which can be extremely dull. Of course, after a few minutes I notice that here too the lack of flavor is unfortunate. (Even all the official signage is light grey on dark grey, no color at all.) The crowds here all appear very American except for the flight crew from Qatar making their way to a nearby gate. A pleasant surprise is the lack of PA announcements, but it only reinforces the corporate atmosphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flight to Toronto is only half full. Just after takeoff, we pass through some strong turbulence. I can make out thunderheads lit from below by the suburban sprawl. Soon the ride settles out, and thankfully the baby one row behind me calms down as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is clear as we arrive in Toronto. The CN Tower is lit modestly; the rest of the city looks crisp in the cool night air. A mix of orange and white streetlights stretch out to the horizon. The terminal is dark, which is appropriate as it’s nearing eleven PM. We clear passport control and continue to our connecting gate. Only after boarding the 777 do I start hearing the spanish all around me. I’ll do my best to sleep on this ten hour journey to the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;30-november-2016&quot;&gt;30 November 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;About 40 minutes from landing in Santiago, I wake up and slide my window open. Outside, I see mountains bathing in bright sunshine, snowcapped and majestic. I hadn’t slept well. A number of crying children and a consistently bumpy ride never allowed me to get real sleep, although I’m not sure what I expected. My body hasn’t yet decided if the fact that there is only a two hour time difference between Atlanta and Santiago is good or bad, but I’m currently not excited for another three hours of flying later today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dumping our plane snacks from America and clearing customs, we are surrounded by drivers hounding for a fare into the city. Most speak good english, but we turn them down - we’re not looking for a ride. After checking bags for this afternoon’s flight, we get on a bus into town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The beautiful views from 10,000 feet are now completely hidden by a blanket of smog. Speeding into town, sports fields fill the space between the highway and frontage roads. The pavement is full, mostly small sedans and buses, but also plenty of mopeds. We get off in a commercial district on the fringe of downtown and start to wander. School children enjoy their lunch and ice cream under trees in a park. Walking through a college campus there’s a non-zero chance of being hit by a stray water balloon. We’re clearly foreign, but never bothered. The storefronts on one street are selling electric motors of every shape and size. We buy some food for the rest of the trip (we’re unsure what sort of supplies are available in Punta Arenas and Puerto Natales, or if there is a significant markup) and catch the bus back to the airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-02-flying.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Mountains below while flying south from Santiago to Punta Arenas&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in the air above Santiago, I can’t help but notice that the plane I’m riding in certainly isn’t helping all that smog. As we head further south, the mountainous terrain shifts from desert to forest to snowcapped peaks. Haze and high-altitude clouds play tricks with the afternoon sun to create two horizon lines. The snowcapped peaks shift back into forested land, still rugged, and now dotted with lakes all begging to be explored. The shadows grow long and peaks shine in the golden light. The last hour is less eventful - clouds blanket the terrain and it’s getting dark. As we slip under the clouds and see a tanker in the Straight of Magellan on the approach to Punta Arenas, my buddy takes in the view as twilight fades and rain falls: “Depressing, isn’t it?” I’m thinking just the opposite.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;1-december-2016&quot;&gt;1 December 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It feels like town is still waking up as we wander from our hostel to the grocery store. Now in the light it’s still hard to get a feel for Punta Arenas. I wouldn’t classify anything as run down, but there isn’t anything new or flashy either. We’ll get a better understanding of town when we pass through after coming off the trail. In the grocery store we gather some looks but no trouble as we collect food we’ll be able to pack. We’re only slow because we don’t have a plan - the store is a fully stocked grocery. I’m surprised that even with a bag packed full of food, the stray dogs are just as lethargic as they were earlier; not a single one lifts even an eye as we pass.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I purchase bus tickets in only slightly fumbled spanish and we’re soon on our way to Puerto Natales. While the plane from Santiago was mostly Chilenos, today’s bus is mostly foreigners. It’s overcast with rain off and on as we pass through the rolling windswept terrain. Long stretches of straight pavement don’t exactly help the monotony, and after a few naps I’m happy to see peaks on the horizon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-03-natales.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View from the waterfront in Puerto Natales&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The business district in Puerto Natales has an oddly American feel. Checking in at our &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erraticrock.com/hostel/&quot;&gt;hostel&lt;/a&gt; is honestly a bit too comfortable: our host is from Minnesota and everyone here speaks english, but on the plus side we’re able to catch a great &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.erraticrock.com/equipment/info-seminars-1/&quot;&gt;presentation&lt;/a&gt; about hiking in the park at the gear store right next door. One more afternoon of wandering before we hit the trail results in dried fruit and a variety of nuts from a hole in the wall shop, almost getting blown off a dock, and our first real encounter with a stray dog. Town shifts from shopping to dinner where we’re seated with a great view of a chef roasting a whole lamb over an open fire. We’re satisfied and head to bed early, excited and anxious to get on the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;2-december-2016&quot;&gt;2 December 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My mattress felt like a box spring last night, so I’m thrilled to wake up for breakfast at 6:15am. We share eggs and granola at the hostel with others also headed into the park today, then make our way to the bus station. It’s a bit of a mad house: there are at least three different bus companies headed into the park all leaving at the same time, some with multiple loads. We get our bags on and find seats for another two hours of sitting. Luckily the terrain is much more interesting now, but the early morning sun turns the bus into a greenhouse, fogging up the windows to the West. The road turns to gravel, but we continue to speed along despite the bumpy ride.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the outskirts of the park, we’re treated to a reminder that we’re in the southern hemisphere. There are about 50 wild flamingos standing on the banks of a nearly dry lake bed. To be honest, the scene looks like it’s straight out of a North American zoo, except there’s a distinct lack of terrible food and children in strollers. We turn another corner and the park’s namesake rock formation are before us. I can’t resist snapping a few photos even though I know we’ll get much better opportunities outside the bus. In just a few more minutes we’re dropped at the Laguna Amarga ranger station to pay the entrance fee, receive a park map, and watch a quick orientation video (don’t make fire!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We don’t even have our packs on before we have a bit of a surprise - this year’s map is missing a trail that is marked on previous versions we had seen online. No worries, we’ll walk the road which should only add an hour or two to an already short first day. The road undulates through the terrain as we get closer and closer to Las Torres and as we crest a hill, we can see green domes and some other buildings in the valley below us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We make it onto actual trail, but it doesn’t feel like backcountry. We pass groups of day hikers and other backpackers what seems like every ten minutes. The forest is like no forest I’ve seen before: it’s moderately dense with a few types of trees each sporting small leaves, none particularly tall, and a blanket of grasses below. Not long after we leave a gate open (as we found it), some horses approach us headed the opposite direction, no other human in sight. Hours later in the river valley a rancher passes by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-04-seron-valley.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View from the trail looking north into the valley where Seron campsite is located&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to call Serón a campsite, but honestly I had no idea what to expect. The host lives in a building with running water and what appears to be an industrial kitchen, a generator, and a satellite dish. There’s some food and beer for sale, albeit at an extremely high (appropriate) markup. We show our permit and set up camp in the field around the outpost. Anton and I meet a couple from Norway while cooking dinner on the porch. It’s still light out as we head to bed. The parrot in the tree above our tent and the music and generator from the outpost don’t help. I make some mental notes about new tent placement strategies and eventually fall asleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;3-december-2016&quot;&gt;3 December 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It rained a bit overnight, but the ground outside, as well as the food we left hanging in a nearby tree, is surprisingly dry. It seems like we’re one of the first few groups out of camp, but it’s hard to tell for sure. Low level clouds occasionally sprinkle rain as we make our way up the river valley. The trail is maybe a bit less crowded than yesterday as there are no day hikers from the Torres Central hotel, but we continue to see groups at least every half hour. Everyone is headed the same direction at this point (as mandated by park rules) so later in the day we intermingle with the same few groups hiking roughly the same speed. The fog and moisture brings out the greens as we cross through plains, forests, and rocky hillsides.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-05-above-lago-paine.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Looking west into fog and mountains from the trail above Lago Paine, about to re-enter park property&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a final short climb, the buildings in the meadow below us look just like an old west US military outpost, complete with a Chilean flag on an improvised pole. A couple icebergs populate the corner of the river, and despite being battered by wind and waves, they don’t budge, likely stuck on rocks below. Eventually we decide that yes, there really is a glacier hiding in the fog across the lake to the north. The views from every direction at Dickson are so different than what we saw on the east side of the park, it’s great to have another day under our belts with time to explore the area, enjoy the colors dancing on the rock faces above camp, and rest our feet before a long day tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-06-dickson-sketch.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Sketch of Dickson&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;4-december-2016&quot;&gt;4 December 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We’re up early to get a good jump on the long day ahead, and luckily it looks like yesterday’s clouds are clearing out. We’re much more efficient taking down camp and decide to get a bit up the trail before taking breakfast. We pause where the forest opens up for a bit revealing a view to the North. The morning light and blue sky create glistening, crisp lines on the glacier. Continuing up the valley the forest is so lush and full of unfamiliar plants that at one point I’m sure I’m in a video game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-07-perros-lookout.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Different colored peaks through the trees at Valle Los Perros Lookout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Words can’t begin to describe the beauty of the terrain we pass through, but there’s one other thing that helps: we haven’t encountered a single other group on the trail. After a break in the shade at the Perros ranger station, we’re fueled up for the steep climb ahead. While it’s hard to tell exactly where the pass is from below, the view down the valley continues to expand. It’s hard to believe how much ground we’ve covered - Dickson is hidden around a ridge far in the distance. Every few minutes the rocks change color and size, but we simply continue up, up, up. Soon enough, I feel a cool wind picking up strength and the saddle is just ahead of me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-08-pass-rocks.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Climbing John Gardner Pass&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few moments of standing in awe, reality catches up and we seek out a windbreak to enjoy the solitude at the top of John Gardner pass. Directly ahead are peaks, some volcanoes, but more impressive is Glacier Grey below, feeding Lago Grey which we can see to the south and extending from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Patagonian_Ice_Field&quot;&gt;Southern Patagonian Ice Sheet&lt;/a&gt; to the north.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-09-pass-pano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;The view from John Gardner Pass&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All of the trail literature warns about the way down from the pass, and they aren’t kidding. I can’t afford to allow the view to steal my focus away from the trail. As we descend, sometimes we find makeshift handrails: rope tied between trees or leftover rebar from anchoring steps. We’re having trouble judging our speed. We’ve been able to complete most sections in about 75% of the quoted time on the map, but this downhill is wrecking us. Just as we’re about to take a break in anticipation of another hour of hiking, we turn a corner to find the Paso ranger station and campsite nestled into the hillside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Camp is very small compared to the others we’ve seen. There is a stream that flows through the tent pads and we immediately choose to set up near it for the benefit of white noise. There’s space for only about twenty tents and not much common area or space for wandering. As it turns out, we’re only joined by two other groups for the evening. The forest is thick, but if you squint you can make out the glacier below. As the sun falls, shadows dance on the broken icy surface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;5-december-2016&quot;&gt;5 December 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The forest here is different yet again; trees grow out of the slope at the horizontal, sometimes turning upward but often just reaching out. We move quickly on good trail that playfully bounces up and down in and around fissures on the hillside. Before too long we’re at the first of two swing bridges. This one looks like it’s straight out of a cartoon: maybe 75 meters long crossing a chasm with sheer faces so deep I can’t see the bottom except when I’m on the bridge. I know I looked down once, but I don’t have anything more than a vague recollection of rushing water and boulders &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; far below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-10-swing-bridge.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Crossing a swing bridge&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yesterday’s solitude is gone as we meet a number of day hikers from Grey out to explore the bridges and get a view of the glacier from above. By the time we arrive at Grey and take lunch on a sunny rock, we’ve heard a couple reports of a trail closure ahead, but no specifics. There’s a ranger station somewhere at Grey, but honestly we’re ready to get back to hiking and out of this bustling village. (Grey is a hike-in location but has a full service lodge/hostel and looks like it could easily hold 100 tents or more.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re now in an area of the park that burned just a couple years ago in a fire reportedly started by someone burning toilet paper. With all the shade gone, the summer sun is intense. The trail is now just a constant stream of people; in the couple hours it takes to hike from Grey to Paine Grande, there’s probably less than 10 minutes total with no other groups in sight. Even so, the vistas are stunning. And meeting people on the trail is a bit interesting. Hikers hail from all around the world; we hear lots of French, Spanish, and German, but also Chinese, Nordic Languages, and others among all flavors of English accents. While in all likelihood English is the more common shared language, most groups acknowledge each other with a simple ¡Hola!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we arrive at Paine Grande, we meet a ranger at the trail junction where we’ll head tomorrow. It’s closed. Luckily the ranger spot-on for this job: he’s totally chill, and also encourages us to just chill out, not worry about reservations, and just go with the flow; the park is amazing even if it’s not what you planned. After gathering a couple more details, we decide that today’s travel isn’t over just yet and race to catch the catamaran docked a couple hundred yards down the shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-11-cat-pano.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;View from the Catamaran&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re a bit baffled, trying to figure out what happens next: where can we get to for the night? Should we have just stayed and caught a possible ferry around the outage? &lt;em&gt;Do we have enough cash?&lt;/em&gt; I try to take the ranger’s advice, and at least for now, it’s easy let my mind wander as I gawk at the incredible view of Cuernos as we speed across the lake. At Pudeto it’s a bit more stressful. We wait on the porch of a cafe which helps break the constant wind, but it’s still cold. Some backpackers are able to hitch rides, but vehicles are few and far between, most already hired private tours understandably not willing to take backpackers. We’re also just not that outgoing and figure we’ll wait for a bus towards Laguna Amarga / Torres Central. Of course, the schedules aren’t super clear - it could be 4 hours.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve never taken a boat and bus ride in the middle of a backpacking trip, but there’s a first time for everything. As the catamaran pulls up to Pudeto after making another round trip, buses from every company rumble in. We’re happy to see them. This run wasn’t listed on our published schedule. An hour or so later, we’re enjoying dinner in the camping zone at Torres Central.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;6-december-2016&quot;&gt;6 December 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The landscape to the west out of Torres Central is again unique, the rocky soil mostly bare and grassy which affords views up towards Cuernos as well as sweeping vistas to the south. A young canadian couple out for a trail run pass us; we see them pause for a selfie on the next ridge before they continue on out of sight. The morning is surprisingly calm, but it is only a matter of time before the trickle of hikers headed towards us becomes a more constant train.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-12-cuernos.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Cuernos del Paine rising above Nordenskjöld Lake&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cuernos del Paine is a beautiful formation, two enormous veins of golden granite capped with red/brown spires, with a third, miniature peak set in front. I’m glad we got the chance to see it from the catamaran and bus yesterday; today’s view is awe-inspiring but a significantly different angle, we’re right beneath the rock. After passing through the bustling Cuernos camp and lodge, the trail quiets down; with the bridge out there won’t have been many people at Italiano last night. It’s slow going on a trail surface of softball sized rocks by the lake; we note swimming opportunities for tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Francés camping zone is sheltered by forest at the base of Valle Francés. We chat with the ranger, set up camp, and give our feet a break. Our day isn’t quite over: today is our chance to venture to the lookouts above camp. We load a single pack with warmth and snacks and start uphill. It’s not too long before the Canadians from this morning pass us headed down; they’ll make it back to Torres Central before dark. We hear mini-avalanches as chunks of ice fall from glaciers and soon enough are rewarded by a view to the glacier from a bald patch. Continuing further up the trail jumps in and out of braided drainages, some forested and wet, others bare and rocky, the result of rockslides and avalanches past.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spend almost an hour at Británico. No pictures can do this place justice, in part because the dancing clouds are even more stunning than the granite which surrounds, rising from every direction.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-13-frances.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Fog rolls through Valle Francés from the Británico lookout&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;7-december-2016&quot;&gt;7 December 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m not really looking forward to today’s hike - it’s mostly just retracing our steps from yesterday. A quick dip in the lake comes just an hour out of camp (would have been more appreciated later in the day?), but it’s still a great refresher. Continuing on, I catch a few views and features that we missed on the way in, but it’s generally predictable and still as crowded as ever. We watch baffled as a group of 25 (!) people who clearly aren’t used to backpacking take a major off-trail detour through scrub on the next ridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re afforded our only solitude of the day as we push up a meadow bypassing the lodge at Torres Central. It’s the last full day and while our packs have lightened up, our legs are tired. We’re anticipating seeing the Torres peak out as we round the corner into valle ascensio, but end up making it all the way to the main trail before we finally pause and refuel. The trail here is more accurately described as a highway - backpackers at every stage of their trip, day hikers, and even horses fill the way up the valley. At Chileno tents occupy wooden platforms built into the steep valley walls and the park’s namesake formation finally shows itself again. After another hour of jockeying with other trail users (and not really paying much attention to the surrounding forest, to be honest), the forest opens up at the bottom of a rock slide and we follow rocks with day-glo yellow tape into camp.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;8-december-2016&quot;&gt;8 December 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My watch alarm goes off at 4am. It’s dark outside, but once I get my bearings it’s obvious we aren’t the only ones awake. The reflective markers make trail-finding surprisingly easy; every time I’m the least bit confused, scanning with my headlamp quickly reveals a new marker. Technically hiking at dark is prohibited by park rules so the reflective hits are an unexpected touch. Above the trees I no longer need a light at all and it’s peaceful to hike in the dark with the lights of other groups seeking the sunrise bouncing around up and down the trail.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Torres is better in person that the photos which make all kinds of weird tricks for scale, but my first impression is that I’d still take Britanico or John Gardner Pass over this view. It doesn’t help that it’s cold and windy, and it doesn’t look like we’re going to experience the storied golden glow of Torres at sunrise - low clouds move quickly but show no signs of breaking up. After an hour or so of watching condors cruise among the spires and pointing out increasingly intricate irregularities in the rock faces, we ask another group to snap a couple photos and head downhill with no regrets.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-14-torres.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Torres del Paine on a foggy morning&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back at Chileno blue sky begins to show itself and light up the towers. We snap a few photos, but to be honest it’s just like yesterday afternoon’s approach. After just another hour flying downhill we’re back at the Torres Central lodge with mixed feelings. An amazing trip with an anti-climactic ending, but more than enough memories. A modern adventure booking office and cafe provides shade, impressively clean washrooms, and a place for us to relax and reflect while waiting for the bus back to Puerto Natales.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our stop at Puerto Natales is unfortunately limited to the bus station. I would have liked to pick up more mixed dried fruit and nuts, but we’ve purchased tickets on to Punta Arenas and town is a 15 minute walk from the bus station. The bus seats aren’t great for sleeping, but it doesn’t matter. I nod in and out of consciousness, catching occasional glimpses across the desolate southern chilean prairie until we finally pull in. After an adventure to the wrong side of town (thanks to a mis-keyed tourist bureau / hostel association map) we check in, drop our packs, and head out for a new adventure: post-trail dinner and beer! I’m still not sure of my feelings on the pizzas we consumed from &lt;a href=&quot;http://dinospizza.cl/&quot;&gt;Dino’s Pizza&lt;/a&gt;, but if anything it was a fitting close to our Torres del Paine adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m happy to still have a couple days in Chile - the backpacking was amazing, but I’m excited to see what else Punta Arenas and Santiago have to offer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;9-december-2016&quot;&gt;9 December 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have one goal for today: Penguins. After a good european breakfast of bread, meats and cheeses, and extremely nutty granola cereal, we walk to a travel agency office pointed out by our host last night. We wouldn’t have figured out this was the right place by simply looking around in town, but we soon have tickets for the tour and all day for more sightseeing - the boat doesn’t leave until 4pm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Punta Arenas is a bit of a strange town, visibly struggling to find an identity and the right mix of industries to support its residents. We climb some stairs to a viewpoint where we can see neighborhoods stretching in every direction. It seems like city center has shifted as industries come and go (farming/ranching, mining, marine/sailing/shipping, and tourism all play a role). Back on the waterfront, a Brazilan flagged navy ship pulls into harbor in the constant wind. We spend over an hour wandering through mausoleum filled rows in the town cemetary. Some are modest, others more ornate. It’s a mix of young and old, and a global population in this port town.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’ve walked all day, but it’s worth mentioning an interesting form of transit in Punta Arenas. Only a few public bus routes run, but most locals don’t need to drive because they use &lt;em&gt;colectivos&lt;/em&gt;. In short, private cars take passengers on fixed routes in a system that’s a mix between a public bus and a shared taxi. I’d estimate that nearly 50% of the vehicles in Punta Arenas are either colectivos or traditional taxi cabs. The frequency win for passengers is great (many colectivo routes seemed to run every minute or two!) with the drawback that a bus is still a more efficient use of space on the road. We end up taking a taxi to the ferry terminal - with three of us it makes sense to guarantee a ride together, and the split cost is roughly equal to the colectivo fare anyways.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m glad that the straight looks calm; I’ve had mild sea-sickness in the past, and four of the next five hours I’ll be on a boat in the Straight of Magellan. The boat, a multi-purpose transport capable of carrying vehicles or large cargo, lowers its ramp and we walk aboard with maybe 150 others. A group ahead of us have patches on their jackets: “Kazakh Antartcitc Expedition 2016.” The cabin at the rear of the boat, rather than crew quarters, is outfitted with rows and rows of seats. Bow empty and pointing to the sky, the trip to Isla Magdalena with the prevailing winds is long but calm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We never really figured out the reasoning for the timing, but I wouldn’t be surprised if sunlight had a factor. Even with a sky of broken clouds, the lighting was fabulous. Oh, and there were penguins. &lt;em&gt;Many, many penguins.&lt;/em&gt; Being a bit early in the season, we were told that only about half the population was present, but the place still felt entirely overrun. We were clearly outsiders, appropriately confined to a meter wide path (which the penguins would wander across if they desired.) Four hours of boat for an hour on the island was a little much for me, but still an experience I’m glad I got to share. Dinner back in town wasn’t exactly anything to write home about, (restaurants were all surprisingly full this evening) but we did get live music from a high-school band playing their first gig and helped our waiter practice his English.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If Punta Arenas can grow into a destination, they’ll have a lot to offer, but my overall impression is still very mixed. All is well; tomorrow we have an early flight back to the capital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;10-december-2016&quot;&gt;10 December 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Santiago is a weird mix of architecture. European and Latin American, old and new; tight neighborhood sectors split by giant boulevards. My memory of this day is quite rushed - after an early flight and then transiting to our hostel with a very friendly taxi driver, I remember a lot of walking. We knocked off many of the sights but didn’t linger much anywhere. The temperature is similar to what we experienced in our earlier excursion to the city, but at least this time we aren’t directly off the plane from Canada. Coming off the trail, it’s hard to not feel overly paranoid of pickpockets as we make our way though the busting city crowds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just across the canal from our hostel we peruse a pop-up market full of video games and anime items. Markets are really the theme. Bellavista is a very Americanized, upscale, interior-facing block of restaurants - I’m not sure why it was on our list - but as we wander the surrounding neighborhood it’s interesting to see that about half of the bars and clubs here are open and serving fairly standard lunch fare. After walking through the garment district (plenty of storefronts are actually factories making shirts or doing alterations), we reach the markets. The Vega, a true farmers’ market, is unlike anything in the states. Narrow aisles are jammed with stalls selling all sorts of produce and it smells fresh and delicious. Seven kilo crates of &lt;em&gt;frutillas&lt;/em&gt; (strawberries) sell for 5000CLP, or about $8. We get lunch in another market, Tirso de Molina, at a restaurant operating four different kitchens distributed alongside stalls selling apparel and trinkets. Fish are thrown in Mercado Central, reminding me that Seattle’s Pike Place Market isn’t as unique as it might play itself off to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bit of natural shade and a wall to sit on are a welcome sight on the way up Castillo Hidalgo. This park is a fun little maze of stairways and castle walls on a hill in the central city, with the summit providing a view about level with the tops of the skyscrapers dotting urban landscape sprawling in every direction. After hitting just about every district in the downtown core, we grab beers at a street cafe before parting ways with Anton who flies out today. Alex and I have another 24 hours in the capital, but right now we’re tired. After a long and hot day of in-town walking - pavement is much less forgiving than bare earth - we fill up on some phenomenal Peruvian fare from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.restaurantolan.com/restaurant-olan/&quot;&gt;Olan&lt;/a&gt; and plot out tomorrow’s adventure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;11-december-2016&quot;&gt;11 December 2016&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning the city has a new face on; lots of stores and closed and the sidewalks are much more quiet. &lt;em&gt;Ciclovia&lt;/em&gt;, a Sunday Parkways / Streets for People event, is closing down as we make our way from the hostel to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.precolombino.cl/&quot;&gt;Museo Chileno de Arte Precolombino&lt;/a&gt;. A few groups of cyclists and rollerskaters whizz by smiling. The museum is phenomenal - most notable to me is an actual &lt;em&gt;quipu&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quipu&quot;&gt;knotted strings&lt;/a&gt; used by the Inca. It’s always cool to see artifacts that are referenced in elementary level history books, especially the ones like this that are totally unbelievable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/chile-16-quipu.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;A portion of a *quipu* on display. The longest thread seen here is about a foot long.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch at a soda fountain, we’re back at the markets to grab some snacks and gifts for the long trek back to the states. The restaurants are hopping, but many of the storefronts are closed today, just like the streets in town. It catches us a bit off guard for this area to be so dead compared to yesterday, but we’re able to find what we need.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“¡Helado Helado Helado Helado Helaaadoooo!” The calls of roving ice-cream vendors echo through the park. We’re killing time in some shade before heading to the airport. The park is reasonably busy with people like us, just passing time: lovers, aspiring athletes, kids with all sorts of activities. An indie photo shoot happening nearby takes advantage of sporadic wind gusting from a tunnel exhaust vent. Making our way back to the hostel to pick up our bags, we discover the beginnings of a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; large parade. Hmmm… hopefully this doesn’t affect our ability to get to the airport. With our full packs now, we have to balance the excitement of the dense crowds on major streets with the reality of making it to the bus station and our flight. After a couple blocks of getting stuck behind vendors selling to families on blankets, we find a parallel route and we’re back on the centropuerto bus, saying ¡Chao! to Santiago and Chile.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Lost Time Orienteering</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;I volunteer with the Cascade Orienteering Club results team, managing software and hardware that verifies course completion and calculates results. As soon as I started in this position, I noticed opportunities to simplify both pre- and post-meet tasks. Working off and on over about a year, I developed a web tool that simplifies the job. Fifteen minute tasks can now be completed in seconds, without worry of error.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/img/posts/LostTimeHeader2.png&quot; alt=&quot;LostTimeOrienteering header&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many of the tasks are data transformation, some are more complex calculations:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Load registration information from a couple sources into the meet management software.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Assign point values to finishers&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Format results for posting to the CascadeOC website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calculate team results&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Calculate series standings&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While the tool is developed for CascadeOC, the architecture is such that any club may be able to leverage the tool for similar tasks with a little bit of additional configuration work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;technical-notes&quot;&gt;Technical Notes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Python is my go-to language, and I’ve now built a number of sites using the &lt;a href=&quot;http://flask.pocoo.org/&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Flask&lt;/a&gt; web development micro-framework. I’m hooked up to a SQLite database, which handles the (tiny) load with no issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major shout-out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/commandline/wsl/about&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Windows Subsystem for Linux (aka Bash/Ubuntu on Windows)&lt;/a&gt;. I’m able to develop on my PC without messing around with VMs or a linux partition, and I get an accurate representation of how the code will run on my web host’s linux box.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view and make your own fork of the code on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/ercjns/LostTime&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;; pull requests welcome.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Pizza Delivery</title>
				
				
					<description>&lt;p&gt;My uncle runs a couple of pizza delivery stores in the Greenville, SC area. His web host and site template provider functionally disappeared in June 2016. I was able to recover most of his site content from the &lt;a href=&quot;https://web.archive.org&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;wayback machine&lt;/a&gt;, but with the editing software gone in the wind, he was unable to make updates. This was as good a catalyst as any to have his site re-built from the ground up.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I’ve built basic websites previously, I had never taken a project where I needed to hand over full control to a less technical person at the end of development. I brushed up on WordPress and spent some time learning about his business before building out his new site. Ultimately we ended up with something I’m proud of and something that my uncle can update himself except in extreme cases, so I’m quite happy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh, and the pizza is good too! If you’re in the area, grab some grub from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.wedgysonline.com&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Wedgy’s Pizza Delivery&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

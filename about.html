## About

Hi, I'm Eric! I build software for people, travel by bicycle or public transit, and love spending time outside. I'm only slightly obsessed with maps. 

What are you passionate about? I'd love to chat with you about sustainability, education, transportation, or anything else that may be on your mind.

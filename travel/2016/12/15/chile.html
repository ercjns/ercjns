<h3 id="29-november-2016">29 November, 2016</h3>
<p>I’m waiting for my first flight in the Atlanta airport’s new international terminal. It’s a lofty white atmosphere with blue accents and much more natural light than other areas of ATL which can be extremely dull. Of course, after a few minutes I notice that here too the lack of flavor is unfortunate. (Even all the official signage is light grey on dark grey, no color at all.) The crowds here all appear very American except for the flight crew from Qatar making their way to a nearby gate. A pleasant surprise is the lack of PA announcements, but it only reinforces the corporate atmosphere.</p>

<p>The flight to Toronto is only half full. Just after takeoff, we pass through some strong turbulence. I can make out thunderheads lit from below by the suburban sprawl. Soon the ride settles out, and thankfully the baby one row behind me calms down as well.</p>

<p>It is clear as we arrive in Toronto. The CN Tower is lit modestly; the rest of the city looks crisp in the cool night air. A mix of orange and white streetlights stretch out to the horizon. The terminal is dark, which is appropriate as it’s nearing eleven PM. We clear passport control and continue to our connecting gate. Only after boarding the 777 do I start hearing the spanish all around me. I’ll do my best to sleep on this ten hour journey to the Southern Hemisphere.</p>

<h3 id="30-november-2016">30 November, 2016</h3>
<p>About 40 minutes from landing in Santiago, I wake up and slide my window open. Outside, I see mountains bathing in bright sunshine, snowcapped and majestic. I hadn’t slept well. A number of crying children and a consistently bumpy ride never allowed me to get real sleep, although I’m not sure what I expected. My body hasn’t yet decided if the fact that there is only a two hour time difference between Atlanta and Santiago is good or bad, but I’m currently not excited for another three hours of flying later today.</p>

<p>After dumping our plane snacks from America and clearing customs, we are surrounded by drivers hounding for a fare into the city. Most speak good english, but we turn them down - we’re not looking for a ride. After checking bags for this afternoon’s flight, we get on a bus into town.</p>

<p>The beautiful views from 10,000 feet are now completely hidden by a blanket of smog. Speeding into town, sports fields fill the space between the highway and frontage roads. The pavement is full, mostly small sedans and buses, but also plenty of mopeds. We get off in a commercial district on the fringe of downtown and start to wander. School children enjoy their lunch and ice cream under trees in a park. Walking through a college campus there’s a non-zero chance of being hit by a stray water balloon. We’re clearly foreign, but never bothered. The storefronts on one street are selling electric motors of every shape and size. We buy some food for the rest of the trip (we’re unsure what sort of supplies are available in Punta Arenas and Puerto Natales, or if there is a significant markup) and catch the bus back to the airport.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/chile-02-flying.jpg" alt="Mountains below while flying south from Santiago to Punta Arenas" /></p>

<p>Back in the air above Santiago, I can’t help but notice that the plane I’m riding in certainly isn’t helping all that smog. As we head further south, the mountainous terrain shifts from desert to forest to snowcapped peaks. Haze and high-altitude clouds play tricks with the afternoon sun to create two horizon lines. The snowcapped peaks shift back into forested land, still rugged, and now dotted with lakes all begging to be explored. The shadows grow long and peaks shine in the golden light. The last hour is less eventful - clouds blanket the terrain and it’s getting dark. As we slip under the clouds and see a tanker in the Straight of Magellan on the approach to Punta Arenas, my buddy takes in the view as twilight fades and rain falls: “Depressing, isn’t it?” I’m thinking just the opposite.</p>

<h3 id="1-december-2016">1 December, 2016</h3>
<p>It feels like town is still waking up as we wander from our hostel to the grocery store. Now in the light it’s still hard to get a feel for Punta Arenas. I wouldn’t classify anything as run down, but there isn’t anything new or flashy either. We’ll get a better understanding of town when we pass through after coming off the trail. In the grocery store we gather some looks but no trouble as we collect food we’ll be able to pack. We’re only slow because we don’t have a plan - the store is a fully stocked grocery. I’m surprised that even with a bag packed full of food, the stray dogs are just as lethargic as they were earlier; not a single one lifts even an eye as we pass.</p>

<p>I purchase bus tickets in only slightly fumbled spanish and we’re soon on our way to Puerto Natales. While the plane from Santiago was mostly Chilenos, today’s bus is mostly foreigners. It’s overcast with rain off and on as we pass through the rolling windswept terrain. Long stretches of straight pavement don’t exactly help the monotony, and after a few naps I’m happy to see peaks on the horizon.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/chile-03-natales.jpg" alt="View from the waterfront in Puerto Natales" /></p>

<p>The business district in Puerto Natales has an oddly American feel. Checking in at our <a href="http://www.erraticrock.com/hostel/">hostel</a> is honestly a bit too comfortable: our host is from Minnesota and everyone here speaks english, but on the plus side we’re able to catch a great <a href="http://www.erraticrock.com/equipment/info-seminars-1/">presentation</a> about hiking in the park at the gear store right next door. One more afternoon of wandering before we hit the trail results in dried fruit and a variety of nuts from a hole in the wall shop, almost getting blown off a dock, and our first real encounter with a stray dog. Town shifts from shopping to dinner where we’re seated with a great view of a chef roasting a whole lamb over an open fire. We’re satisfied and head to bed early, excited and anxious to get on the trail.</p>

<h3 id="2-december-2016">2 December, 2016</h3>
<p>My mattress felt like a box spring last night, so I’m thrilled to wake up for breakfast at 6:15am. We share eggs and granola at the hostel with others also headed into the park today, then make our way to the bus station. It’s a bit of a mad house: there are at least three different bus companies headed into the park all leaving at the same time, some with multiple loads. We get our bags on and find seats for another two hours of sitting. Luckily the terrain is much more interesting now, but the early morning sun turns the bus into a greenhouse, fogging up the windows to the West. The road turns to gravel, but we continue to speed along despite the bumpy ride.</p>

<p>On the outskirts of the park, we’re treated to a reminder that we’re in the southern hemisphere. There are about 50 wild flamingos standing on the banks of a nearly dry lake bed. To be honest, the scene looks like it’s straight out of a North American zoo, except there’s a distinct lack of terrible food and children in strollers. We turn another corner and the park’s namesake rock formation are before us. I can’t resist snapping a few photos even though I know we’ll get much better opportunities outside the bus. In just a few more minutes we’re dropped at the Laguna Amarga ranger station to pay the entrance fee, receive a park map, and watch a quick orientation video (don’t make fire!).</p>

<p>We don’t even have our packs on before we have a bit of a surprise - this year’s map is missing a trail that is marked on previous versions we had seen online. No worries, we’ll walk the road which should only add an hour or two to an already short first day. The road undulates through the terrain as we get closer and closer to Las Torres and as we crest a hill, we can see green domes and some other buildings in the valley below us.</p>

<p>We make it onto actual trail, but it doesn’t feel like backcountry. We pass groups of day hikers and other backpackers what seems like every ten minutes. The forest is like no forest I’ve seen before: it’s moderately dense with a few types of trees each sporting small leaves, none particularly tall, and a blanket of grasses below. Not long after we leave a gate open (as we found it), some horses approach us headed the opposite direction, no other human in sight. Hours later in the river valley a rancher passes by.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/chile-04-seron-valley.jpg" alt="View from the trail looking north into the valley where Seron campsite is located" /></p>

<p>It’s hard to call Serón a campsite, but honestly I had no idea what to expect. The host lives in a building with running water and what appears to be an industrial kitchen, a generator, and a satellite dish. There’s some food and beer for sale, albeit at an extremely high (appropriate) markup. We show our permit and set up camp in the field around the outpost. Anton and I meet a couple from Norway while cooking dinner on the porch. It’s still light out as we head to bed. The parrot in the tree above our tent and the music and generator from the outpost don’t help. I make some mental notes about new tent placement strategies and eventually fall asleep.</p>

<h3 id="3-december-2016">3 December, 2016</h3>
<p>It rained a bit overnight, but the ground outside, as well as the food we left hanging in a nearby tree, is surprisingly dry. It seems like we’re one of the first few groups out of camp, but it’s hard to tell for sure. Low level clouds occasionally sprinkle rain as we make our way up the river valley. The trail is maybe a bit less crowded than yesterday as there are no day hikers from the Torres Central hotel, but we continue to see groups at least every half hour. Everyone is headed the same direction at this point (as mandated by park rules) so later in the day we intermingle with the same few groups hiking roughly the same speed. The fog and moisture brings out the greens as we cross through plains, forests, and rocky hillsides.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/chile-05-above-lago-paine.jpg" alt="Looking west into fog and mountains from the trail above Lago Paine, about to re-enter park property" /></p>

<p>After a final short climb, the buildings in the meadow below us look just like an old west US military outpost, complete with a Chilean flag on an improvised pole. A couple icebergs populate the corner of the river, and despite being battered by wind and waves, they don’t budge, likely stuck on rocks below. Eventually we decide that yes, there really is a glacier hiding in the fog across the lake to the north. The views from every direction at Dickson are so different than what we saw on the east side of the park, it’s great to have another day under our belts with time to explore the area, enjoy the colors dancing on the rock faces above camp, and rest our feet before a long day tomorrow.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/chile-06-dickson-sketch.jpg" alt="Sketch of Dickson" /></p>

<h3 id="4-december-2016">4 December, 2016</h3>
<p>We’re up early to get a good jump on the long day ahead, and luckily it looks like yesterday’s clouds are clearing out. We’re much more efficient taking down camp and decide to get a bit up the trail before taking breakfast. We pause where the forest opens up for a bit revealing a view to the North. The morning light and blue sky create glistening, crisp lines on the glacier. Continuing up the valley the forest is so lush and full of unfamiliar plants that at one point I’m sure I’m in a video game.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/chile-07-perros-lookout.jpg" alt="Different colored peaks through the trees at Valle Los Perros Lookout" /></p>

<p>Words can’t begin to describe the beauty of the terrain we pass through, but there’s one other thing that helps: we haven’t encountered a single other group on the trail. After a break in the shade at the Perros ranger station, we’re fueled up for the steep climb ahead. While it’s hard to tell exactly where the pass is from below, the view down the valley continues to expand. It’s hard to believe how much ground we’ve covered - Dickson is hidden around a ridge far in the distance. Every few minutes the rocks change color and size, but we simply continue up, up, up. Soon enough, I feel a cool wind picking up strength and the saddle is just ahead of me.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/chile-08-pass-rocks.jpg" alt="Climbing John Gardner Pass" /></p>

<p>After a few moments of standing in awe, reality catches up and we seek out a windbreak to enjoy the solitude at the top of John Gardner pass. Directly ahead are peaks, some volcanoes, but more impressive is Glacier Grey below, feeding Lago Grey which we can see to the south and extending from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_Patagonian_Ice_Field">Southern Patagonian Ice Sheet</a> to the north.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/chile-09-pass-pano.jpg" alt="The view from John Gardner Pass" /></p>

<p>All of the trail literature warns about the way down from the pass, and they aren’t kidding. I can’t afford to allow the view to steal my focus away from the trail. As we descend, sometimes we find makeshift handrails: rope tied between trees or leftover rebar from anchoring steps. We’re having trouble judging our speed. We’ve been able to complete most sections in about 75% of the quoted time on the map, but this downhill is wrecking us. Just as we’re about to take a break in anticipation of another hour of hiking, we turn a corner to find the Paso ranger station and campsite nestled into the hillside.</p>

<p>Camp is very small compared to the others we’ve seen. There is a stream that flows through the tent pads and we immediately choose to set up near it for the benefit of white noise. There’s space for only about twenty tents and not much common area or space for wandering. As it turns out, we’re only joined by two other groups for the evening. The forest is thick, but if you squint you can make out the glacier below. As the sun falls, shadows dance on the broken icy surface.</p>

<h3 id="5-december-2016">5 December, 2016</h3>
<p>The forest here is different yet again; trees grow out of the slope at the horizontal, sometimes turning upward but often just reaching out. We move quickly on good trail that playfully bounces up and down in and around fissures on the hillside. Before too long we’re at the first of two swing bridges. This one looks like it’s straight out of a cartoon: maybe 75 meters long crossing a chasm with sheer faces so deep I can’t see the bottom except when I’m on the bridge. I know I looked down once, but I don’t have anything more than a vague recollection of rushing water and boulders <em>very</em> far below.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/chile-10-swing-bridge.jpg" alt="Crossing a swing bridge" /></p>

<p>Yesterday’s solitude is gone as we meet a number of dayhikers from Grey out to explore the bridges and get a view of the glacier from above. By the time we arrive at Grey and take lunch on a sunny rock, we’ve heard a couple reports of a trail closure ahead, but no specifics. There’s a ranger station somewhere at Grey, but honestly we’re ready to get back to hiking and out of this bustling village. (Grey is a hike-in location but has a full service lodge/hostel and looks like it could easily hold 100 tents or more.)</p>

<p>We’re now in an area of the park that burned just a couple years ago in a fire reportedly started by someone burning toilet paper. With all the shade gone, the summer sun is intense. The trail is now just a constant stream of people; in the couple hours it takes to hike from Grey to Paine Grande, there’s probably less than 10 minutes total with no other groups in sight. Even so, the vistas are stunning. And meeting people on the trail is a bit interesting. Hikers hail from all around the world; we hear lots of French, Spanish, and German, but also Chinese, Nordic Languages, and others among all flavors of English accents. While in all likelihood English is the more common shared language, most groups acknowledge each other with a simple ¡Hola!</p>

<p>As we arrive at Paine Grande, we meet a ranger at the trail junction where we’ll head tomorrow. It’s closed. Luckily the ranger spot-on for this job: he’s totally chill, and also encourages us to just chill out, not worry about reservations, and just go with the flow; the park is amazing even if it’s not what you planned. After gathering a couple more details, we decide that today’s travel isn’t over just yet and race to catch the catamaran docked a couple hundred yards down the shore.</p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/chile-11-cat-pano.jpg" alt="View from the Catamaran" /></p>

<p>We’re a bit baffled, trying to figure out what happens next: where can we get to for the night? Should we have just stayed and caught a possible ferry around the outage? <em>Do we have enough cash?</em> I try to take the ranger’s advice, and at least for now, it’s easy let my mind wander as I gawk at the incredible view of Cuernos as we speed across the lake. At Pudeto it’s a bit more stressful. We wait on the porch of a cafe which helps break the constant wind, but it’s still cold. Some backpackers are able to hitch rides, but vehicles are few and far between, most already hired private tours understandably not willing to take backpackers. We’re also just not that outgoing and figure we’ll wait for a bus towards Laguna Amarga / Torres Central. Of course, the schedules aren’t super clear - it could be 4 hours.</p>

<p>I’ve never taken a boat and bus ride in the middle of a backpacking trip, but there’s a first time for everything. As the catamaran pulls up to Pudeto after making another round trip, buses from every company rumble in. We’re happy to see them. This run wasn’t listed on our published schedule. An hour or so later, we’re enjoying dinner in the camping zone at Torres Central.</p>

<p>To be continued…</p>
